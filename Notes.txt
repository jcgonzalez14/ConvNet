Notes:

 - importing VGGFace was not working so I had to go to /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/keras_vggface/models.py to change to by changing period to underscore:
 - from keras_applications.imagenet_utils import _obtain_input_shape 


Things to work on:
 - Tensorboard
 - CNN visualized 
 - Add Google Analytics tracking code
 - include links/estimated reading time 


Parameters to adjust:
 - batch 
 - epochs
 - optimizer
 - loss
 - model 

Cropping the pictures closer to the users face helps model accuracy rates but have yet to see those high rates for the validation set.
